# A Aquarium of threads

## A JAVA Swing Project


Java application development which simulates running of several threads in parallel,
With an aquarium, where there are animals

Each animal has: size, and speed, there are marine animals that move only horizontally and there are animals moving in 2 axes x, y.
These animals also have an indication that they are hungry (with a circle around them) meaning that they are hungry every time, according to the settings you gave in adding them.

And when there is less than 20% food supply, then half of the animals moving in each direction freeze and do not move. (wait - go to sleep and to wake up)

The main point of this project is to show how to use threads, and develop visual GUI application with Java.

You can run the project by running the file _Aqurium4.jar_
